# Changelog

All notable changes to Clip are documented here.

## Unreleased

### New features

**Reader Tab**
- New tab (⌘2) for viewing markdown files and folders, rendered with Clip's warm preview styling
- Open via Finder "Open With Clip" (`.md`, `.markdown`, `.txt` registered as viewable document types), drag-and-drop onto the window, menu bar → "View Markdown File…/Folder…", ⌘O/⌘⇧O, or the recents list
- Folder mode: collapsible sidebar file tree of all markdown files (hidden files skipped, empty folders pruned)
- Live reload — files edited in another app refresh the preview automatically (survives atomic saves)
- One-click actions: copy as HTML, copy as rich text, edit in Transform tab, reveal in Finder

**Markdown engine upgrades** (Reader, Transform preview, Notes, CLI)
- Fenced code blocks (``` and ~~~) with HTML escaping
- Ordered lists (`1.` / `1)`)
- GitHub-style task lists (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) with styled checkboxes
- YAML frontmatter rendered as a muted metadata block instead of leaking into the document

### Improvements
- ⌘1–⌘5 keyboard shortcuts to switch tabs (shown in tooltips)
- Redesigned onboarding: introduces all five tools in the app's warm visual language
- Transform tab editors now match the warm theme (no more stark white)
- Fixed crash when launching the app by opening a document (open event arrives before the panel exists)
- Fixed stale `NoteStore` test referencing removed `todayNote` API

### Hardening (post-review fixes)
- Notes checkboxes now toggle by exact source line (`data-line` emitted by the renderer) — task-like
  text inside code fences or frontmatter can no longer shift clicks onto the wrong line
- Frontmatter detection requires every line between the `---` fences to look like YAML, so documents
  opening with a horizontal rule are no longer swallowed into a metadata block
- Reader rejects non-markdown and oversized (>8 MB) files with a clear error instead of rendering garbage
- "Open With" registration narrowed to markdown UTIs only (no longer claims all plain-text files)
- Live-reload watcher survives atomic saves and delete/recreate cycles (debounced, re-arms on the new inode)
- Folder scans run off the main thread with a 25k-entry budget — huge folders no longer freeze the panel
- `htmlToMarkdown` round-trips the new constructs: task checkboxes, ordered lists, multi-line code fences,
  and frontmatter
- Ordered lists follow the CommonMark interrupt rule (only `1.` may break a paragraph) — hard-wrapped
  prose like "extension\n5) press star" stays a paragraph
- Preview WebViews skip identical reloads, preserving scroll position during UI state changes
- Markdown is rendered once per content change (cached in the store) instead of on every view update

## v1.5.0 — 2026-04-26

### New features

**Notes Tab** (#15)
- Daily markdown editor built into the main window (tab 4)
- Auto-creates a "today" note on first open
- Inline markdown styling (bold, italic, strikethrough, code, headings, blockquotes)
- Keyword expansion: `::meeting`, `::proposal`, `::slides`, `::table`, `::today`, `::tomorrow`, `[ ]`
- Preview rendered markdown with interactive checkboxes
- Send note to Transform tab, copy to clipboard, export as `.md`

**Compact Icon Titlebar**
- Replaced segmented tab picker with compact SF Symbol icon buttons inline with traffic lights
- Each icon has a hover tooltip (Assets, Transform, Text Formatter, Notes)
- Theme cycle and pin-to-top controls in the same row
- Eliminated rogue `WindowGroup` window that was causing the tab bar to render invisible on first launch

**Quick Look Extension**
- `.clip` vault files preview in Finder via Quick Look
- CLI quarantine fix bundled

**Bundled CLI**
- `clip` command-line tool bundled inside the app
- Prompts to install on first launch; also available via menu bar → Install CLI…

### Bug fixes

- Fixed `WindowGroup` creating a second standard window on launch — tab icons were rendering behind the native titlebar material and appearing invisible
- Fixed paste-as-PNG producing empty files
- Fixed Markdown preview routing between tabs
- Fixed `@rpath` for `Sparkle.framework` so the app launches correctly when built with SPM
- Fixed `ClipQLGenerator` excluded from SPM target (requires Developer ID to build)

- "Paste PNG" toolbar button converts any clipboard image to PNG asset
- Error alert when clipboard is empty or non-image

## v1.3.0 — 2026-04-08

### New features

**App Icon**
- Custom paperclip mascot icon — replaces the generic macOS app icon in Finder, Dock (when visible), and About dialogs

**Split View for Transform tab** (#2)
- Toggle button switches between stacked (vertical) and side-by-side (horizontal) layout
- Compare input and output content side by side for easier review

**Auto-Update** (#3)
- Checks GitHub Releases on launch for newer versions (silent — only shows an alert when an update is found)
- "Check for Updates…" menu item for manual checks
- One-click download of the latest DMG from the update alert

**Export/Import Vault** (#4)
- **GUI**: "Export Vault…" / "Import Vault…" menu items with native file dialogs
- **CLI**: `clip export` and `clip import` subcommands
  - Supports stdin/stdout piping and `--file` flag
  - Validates JSON before importing; vault unchanged on invalid input
- Pretty-printed JSON output for human-readable backups
- Import replaces the full vault (with confirmation dialog in GUI)

### Changes
- `build_dmg.sh` now copies `AppIcon.icns` into the app bundle and sets `CFBundleIconFile` in Info.plist
- CLI help updated with export/import subcommand documentation
- Version bumped to 1.3.0

---

## v1.2.1 — 2026-04-07

### Bug fixes

- **Fixed DMG producing a broken Clip.app** — the `Clip` (app) and `clip` (CLI) product names collided on macOS's case-insensitive filesystem, causing the CLI binary to overwrite the app binary. Renamed CLI product to `clip-tool` in Package.swift; end-user `clip` command name is unchanged.
- Removed dead `AIService` test stubs that referenced an unimplemented class, fixing `swift test` failures.

### Changes
- Updated `build_dmg.sh`, `install_cli.sh`, README, and docs to reflect the `clip-tool` product rename.

---

## v1.2.0 — 2026-04-06

### New features

**`clip` CLI companion**
- New `clip` command-line binary: `md2html`, `html2md`, `md2social` subcommands
- Reads from stdin by default; `--clipboard` / `-c` flag transforms clipboard in-place (no pipes needed)
- Bundled in the DMG alongside the app — double-click "Install CLI.command" to install

**Package restructure**
- `ClipCore` library extracted: pure-Foundation transformers (`RichTextTransformer` HTML methods, `TableTransformer`, `UnicodeTextFormatter`) shared between app and CLI
- `AppKit` extension on `RichTextTransformer` remains in the app target only

### Changes
- "Send Feedback" menu item now opens GitHub Issues instead of email
- Removed unused `AIView` and stub `AIService` (AI slide generation was not wired up)
- Implemented Move Line Up/Down in Text Formatter overflow menu
- `build_dmg.sh` now builds both `Clip` and `clip` binaries and stages full DMG with install script

## v1.1.0 — 2026-04-05

**[Download Clip-1.1.0.dmg](https://github.com/blacklogos/markutils/releases/download/v1.1.0/Clip-1.1.0.dmg)**

### New features

**Unicode Text Formatter (Convert mode)**
- New **Format / Convert** segmented picker in the Text Formatter tab
- **MD → Unicode**: converts full markdown to Unicode-styled plain text — bold, italic, monospace, strikethrough, bullet points, headers, blockquotes, horizontal rules, links, and embedded tables
- **Table → ASCII**: converts markdown tables to box-drawing tables (┌─┬─┐/╞═╪═╡ style)
- 8 style buttons apply Unicode styling to selections: 𝐁old, 𝘐talic, 𝒃𝒊 Bold Italic, 𝚖onospace, 𝒮cript, ꜱᴄ Small Caps, u̲nderline, s̶trikethrough
- **Revert** button strips all Unicode styling back to plain ASCII
- `Sources/Utilities/UnicodeTextFormatter.swift` — standalone utility with no dependencies

**Warm Minimal UI**
- Compressed header: two rows (title + tabs) → single 40px row
- Icon-only tabs with `.help()` tooltips for discoverability
- Theme cycle button — cycles System ⊙ → Light ☀️ → Dark 🌙
- Status bar on Transform and Text Formatter tabs: word count · char count · Ln/Col
- Centralized warm color palette (`AppColors`) responding to light/dark mode changes dynamically

**Text Formatter toolbar collapse**
- Format mode: 3 rows of buttons → 1 compact row
- Overflow **⋯** menu: extra bullet types, move line up/down, fix spaces, emoji inserts, number emojis, footer
- Removed redundant Undo/Redo buttons (Cmd+Z/Shift+Z work natively)
- Copy button now uses amber accent color

### Changes

- `HTMLPreviewView`: body font changed to Georgia serif; headers remain sans-serif; all colors via CSS custom properties with warm light/dark variants; blockquote border uses amber accent
- `AssetGridView`, `QuickActionsView`: warm background colors applied
- `ContentView`: header rebuilt from scratch as single `HStack`; draggable gap between tabs and controls
- `AppColors.swift` (new): centralized palette using `NSColor(name:dynamicProvider:)` for correct light/dark transitions without needing `@Environment` at call sites
- `StatusBarView.swift` (new): reusable 22px bar with word count, char count, Ln/Col
- `docs/solutions/` (new): solution documentation for Unicode scalar arithmetic pattern and NSColor dynamic provider pattern

### Bug fixes
